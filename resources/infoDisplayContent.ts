        "Welcome to \"Whispers in the Dark,\" an AI-powered text adventure game where your choices directly shape your fate. Uncover secrets, manage your inventory, and survive the challenges presented by an enigmatic Dungeon Master powered by Google's Gemini AI. Choose a starting theme and dive into quests and dangers unique to that setting."

        "Core Gameplay Loop: Read the scene description, then choose one of the provided action options, or use any of your items. Your actions determine the story's progression.",
        "Inventory: You'll acquire items throughout your adventure. Items can be gained, lost, or used. Some items have specific \"Known Uses\" that unlock as you interact with them or the environment. You can \"Inspect\" items for more details or \"Attempt to Use\" them in a generic way if no specific use is known or applicable. Item types include single-use, multi-use, equipment, containers, keys, weapons, ammunition, vehicles, immovable features, and status effects.",
        "Quests & Objectives: Each theme typically has an \"Overarching Quest\" (a long-term goal) and a \"Current Objective\" (a short-term task). Completing objectives grants Score points and advances the story. The game follows a five-act story arc. Completing the final act finishes the game.",
        "Local Context: The game tracks \"Local Time,\" \"Local Environment,\" and \"Local Place.\" These details are influenced by your actions and the AI's narrative, providing a more immersive experience. The AI uses this context to generate scenes and the Image Visualizer uses it to create more accurate pictures.",
        "Score & Custom Actions: You earn Score points primarily by completing objectives. These points can be spent to perform \"Custom Actions\" by typing your desired action into the input field. Custom actions cost points and have a character limit.",
        "Starting Theme: At the beginning of each adventure, you choose which theme to play in, setting the tone for your journey."

        "Manual Save/Load: You can manually save your game to a file (`.json`) and load it later using the dedicated toolbar buttons. This is useful for backups or transferring saves between devices.",
        "Game Updates & Save Compatibility: \"Whispers in the Dark\" is an evolving game. While we strive for backward compatibility with save files, significant updates that change the game's data structure might affect older saves. The game tracks a `saveGameVersion` (currently: {{CURRENT_SAVE_GAME_VERSION}}). If you load a save from an older version, the game will attempt to adapt it. For example, if a new field like \"Local Place\" is added, the game might infer its value or use a default for older saves. However, very old or structurally incompatible saves might not load correctly or could lead to unexpected behavior. It's always a good idea to manually save your game before major updates if you wish to preserve a specific state."
