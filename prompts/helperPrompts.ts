- "vehicle": Player's current transport (if isActive: true) or one they can enter if adjacent to it. Integral parts (mounted guns, cargo bays) are 'knownUses', NOT separate items unless detached. If player enters a vehicle, note in "playerItemsHint" that it becomes active. If they exit, note that it becomes inactive. Include the vehicle in "newItems" only when first introduced.
- "immovable": Built-in or heavy feature at a location (e.g., control panel or machinery). Cannot be moved or stored. Interact using known uses or generic attempts.

## Examples illustrating the hint style:

### Example of creating a *new* item "Old Lantern" and placing it in player's inventory. Because "Old Lantern" is included in newItems, it means the item is not already present in the scene:
playerItemsHint: "Picked up Old Lantern."
newItems:
[
  {
    "activeDescription": "The lantern is lit and casts a warm glow.",
    "description": "A dusty old lantern that still flickers faintly.",
    "isActive": false,
    "knownUses": [
      {
        "actionName": "Light the Lantern",
        "appliesWhenInactive": true,
        "description": "Use this to light your way in dark places.",
        "promptEffect": "Light the lantern to illuminate the area."
      },
      {
        "actionName": "Extinguish the Lantern",
        "appliesWhenActive": true,
        "description": "Extinguish the lantern and conserve fuel.",
        "promptEffect": "Extinguish the lantern."
      }
    ],
    "name": "Old Lantern",
    "type": "equipment"
  }
]

### Example for creating a *new* item "Rusty Key" inside npc-guard-4f3a inventory:
npcItemsHint: "Guard now carries a Rusty Key."
newItems:
[
  {
    "description": "A key for the armory door.",
    "holderId": "npc-guard-4f3a",
    "name": "Rusty Key",
    "type": "key"
  }
]

### Example of creating a *new* 'page' written item and placing it in player's inventory (same structure for the 'map' and 'picture' types):
librarianHint: "Found Smudged Note."
newItems:
[
  {
    "chapters": /* REQUIRED, because the type is 'page' */
    [ /* Only one chapter, because the type is 'page' */
      {
        "contentLength": 50,
        "description": "A hastily scribbled message about the dangers of the sunken tunnel.",
        "heading": "string"
      }
    ],
    "description": "A hastily scribbled message with a big smudge over it.",
    "holderId": "player",
    "name": "Smudged Note",
    "tags": ["typed", "smudged"],
    "type": "page"
  }
]

### Example of creating a *new* 'book' written item and placing it in player's inventory:
librarianHint: "Obtained the Explorer's Adventures."
newItems:
[
  {
    "chapters": /* REQUIRED, because the type is 'book' */
    [ /* Multiple chapters because the type it 'book' */
      {
        "contentLength": 53,
        "description": "Introduction. Written by the author, explaining his decisions to start his travels.",
        "heading": "Preface"
      },
      {
        "contentLength": 246,
        "description": "First trip. The author travelled to Vibrant Isles in the search of the Endless Waterfall",
        "heading": "Journey One"
      },
      {
        "contentLength": 312,
        "description": "Second Trip. The author's adventure in Desolate Steppes in the search of Magnificent Oasis",
        "heading": "Journey Two"
      },
      {
        "contentLength": 98,
        "description": "The author's contemplation about whether the journeys were worth it",
        "heading": "Final Thoughts"
      }
    ],
    "description": "Weathered log of travels.",
    "holderId": "player",
    "name": "Explorer's Adventures",
    "tags": ["handwritten", "faded"],
    "type": "book"
  }
]

### Example for losing, destroying, completely removing the item:
playerItemsHint: "Lost Old Lantern (flickering)."

### Example for giving an *existing* item from one holder to another:
npcItemsHint: "Gave Iron Sword to Guard."

### "take" is an alias for "give". Example:
playerItemsHint: "Took Coin Pouch from Bandit."

### Example for simple update of *existing* item (only changing "isActive"):
playerItemsHint: "Plasma Torch is now active."

### Example for transformation or crafting:
playerItemsHint: "Scrap Metal transformed into Makeshift Shiv."

### Example for adding a known use to an item without changing anything else:
playerItemsHint: "Mystic Orb can now 'Peer into the Orb'."

- ALWAYS appropriately handle spending single-use items and state toggles ("isActive": true/false).
- Make sure that 'page', 'map' and 'picture' type items have exactly ONE chapter.
- Make sure that 'book' type items have between ${String(MIN_BOOK_CHAPTERS)} and ${String(MAX_BOOK_CHAPTERS)} chapters.
- Make sure 'page', 'book', 'map' and 'picture' type items have one of the required tags: ${TEXT_STYLE_TAGS_STRING}.
- Using some "single-use" items (food, water, medicine, etc) MUST add or remove appropriate "status effects".
- Mention remaining uses for multi-use items when they change.
IMPORTANT: For items that CLEARLY can be enabled or disabled (e.g., light sources, powered equipment, wielded or worn items) provide at least the two knownUses to enable and disable them with appropriate names:
  - The knownUse to turn on, light, or otherwise enable the item should ALWAYS have "appliesWhenInactive": true (and typically "appliesWhenActive": false or undefined).
  - The knownUse to turn off, extinguish, or disable the item should ALWAYS have "appliesWhenActive": true (and typically "appliesWhenInactive": false or undefined).
  - ALWAYS provide these actions in pairs, e.g. turn on/turn off, wield/put away, wear/take off, light/extinguish, activate/deactivate, start/stop, etc.
IMPORTANT: NEVER add people, NPCs, or map locations as items.
IMPORTANT: NEVER add ${DEDICATED_BUTTON_USES_STRING} known uses - there are dedicated buttons for those in the game.

- district: Subdivision of a settlement or complex, including streets or sectors.
- exterior: Outside of a single structure or vehicle.
- interior: Inside of a structure or vehicle.

- path: Narrow walking trail or hallway.
- road: Major route or street for ground travel.
- sea route: Travel across open water or space lanes.
- door: Physical entry like doors, gates, hatches, or airlocks.
- teleporter: Instant or rapid transit portals and lifts.

- river_crossing: Means of crossing water or similar obstacles.
- temporary_bridge: Deployable link such as a boarding tube or rope bridge.
- boarding_hook: Grappling device to connect to a moving object.
- shortcut: Any special connection that bypasses hierarchy rules.`;

export const MAP_NODE_HIERARCHY_GUIDE = `Map Node Hierarchy:
- A "region" can contain "locations".
- A "location" can contain "settlements".
- A "settlement" can contain "districts".
- A "district" can contain "exteriors".
- An "exterior" can contain "interiors".
- An "interior" can contain "rooms".
- A "room" can contain "features".
- The "${ROOT_MAP_NODE_ID}" is the root node, it can contain any other nodes.
- A "feature" can be placed anywhere in the hierarchy, but can never be a parent to any other node.
- Only "feature" nodes can be connected to each other with edges.`;

export const LOCAL_CONDITIONS_GUIDE = `- You MUST provide "localTime", "localEnvironment", "localPlace" in the response.
- "localTime" should be a very short phrase (e.g., "Dawn", "Mid-morning", "Twilight", "Deep Night", "Temporal Flux").
- "localEnvironment" should be a concise sentence describing immediate ambient conditions (e.g., "A gentle breeze rustles leaves.", "The air is stale and smells of decay.", "Rain lashes against the windows.", "A low hum pervades the metallic corridor.").
- "localPlace" is a free-form string describing the player's current specific position.
  - It can use relational words with a known Map Node (which represent main locations or significant features, e.g., "inside the Old Mill", "in front of the Stone Altar").
  - It can describe positions between known Map Nodes (e.g., "on the path between the Whispering Woods and the Crystal Cave", "en-route from Port Blacksand to the Serpent's Isle").
  - The new "localPlace" must be a logical continuation from the previous "localPlace", considering the player's action and the scene's outcome. Update "localPlace" whenever the player moves, their immediate surroundings change significantly, or they transition between distinct areas.
- These details MUST be updated as the narrative progresses and be in agreement with the "sceneDescription".
